The described project is a face recognition system built using the OpenCV library, along with the support of Python programming language, Numpy and OpenCV. The system is based on a mini-size deep learning model to perform the recognition.

The first step in building the system was the data processing stage, where 100 images were collected and processed. In order to prepare the images for training the model, they were converted to grayscale using OpenCV. The reason for converting the images to grayscale is that it simplifies the process and reduces the computational requirements, making it more efficient and easier to implement.

The next step was the training stage, where the dataset was split into two segments - train and test data. 75% of the images were used for training the model and 25% were used for testing its performance. This split is commonly used in machine learning and helps to assess the accuracy of the model by evaluating it on a different set of data.

Overall, the implementation of the face recognition system involved using several libraries and models related to machine learning, along with the Python programming language. The combination of these tools allowed for the efficient and effective development of the system, making it capable of accurately recognizing faces in images.
